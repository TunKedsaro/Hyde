Yesterday
- I set up the project structure and deployed the project to Cloud Run
- I ran ETL for roles and skills into the Gold layer database
  Yesterday, I attempted to update the table, but I don't have the permission.
  It might need to be run by you or P'Buth, or I can proceed if permission is granted.
Today 
- I will upload the data:
    - feeds.json
    - interactions.csv
    - students.csv
- I will develop the HyDE generation engine with YAML-configurable prompts and settings
